# Relays we want notifications for when they reappear. This can be done by
# address (single addresses or ranges) or fingerprints.
#
# Anything in this file is public. All entries *MUST* have a description and an
# expiration date for when it can be removed. The description is particularly
# important so we can puzzle out why we were monitoring for this if it
# reappears.
#
# Few examples...
